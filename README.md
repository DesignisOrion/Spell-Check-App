# Spell Check App

### About 
This program allows you to make corrections to mispelled words. The goal is to add this to the Forde Text Editor build prior. Enjoy

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- PySpellCheck

### What I learned:

In this project I was able to work with the pyspellchecker. This app allows us to do spell checking of certain words we may feel "ify" about lol. The program is pretty straight forward with documentation so it wasn't to hard to learn.  The goal is to have the program implemented into the Forde Text Editor. Enjoy!
